def create_csv_if_not_exists():
    """
        This function "create_csv_if_not_exists()" checks if the file named emp_details.csv exists in the current directory.
        If the file does not exist, it creates a new file with that name and writes a header row to it. The header row
        contains the following fields:
        -> Emp_Id
        -> Name
        -> Designation,
        -> Salary
        -> Age
        -> Gender
        -> Email
        -> Phno.
        If the file already exists, the function prints a message indicating that the file already exists.

        This function reads the contents of a CSV file named emp_details.csv located in the current directory.

        (excluding the first three characters) and appends it to a list called employee_ids. If the file does 
        not exist, it prints a message indicating that the file does not exist. Finally, it returns the list of employee IDs.
